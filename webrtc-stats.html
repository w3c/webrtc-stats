        Introduction
      </h2>
      <p>
        Audio, video, or data packets transmitted over a peer-connection can be lost, and
        experience varying amounts of network delay. A web application implementing WebRTC expects
        to monitor the performance of the underlying network and media pipeline.
      </p>
      <p>
        This document defines the APIs and statistic identifiers used by the web application to
        extract metrics from the user agent.

      <p>
        This specification defines the conformance criteria that applies to a single product: the
        <em>user agent</em>.

        Implementations that use ECMAScript to implement the APIs and objects defined in this
        specification <em class="rfc2119" title="MUST">MUST</em> implement them in a manner
        consistent with the ECMAScript Bindings defined in the Web IDL specification [[WEBIDL]], as
        this document uses that specification and terminology.
      </p>
      <p>
        This specification does not define what objects a conforming implementation should
        generate. Specifications that refer to this specification have the need to specify
        conformance. They should put in their document text like this:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>An implementation MUST support generating statistics for the type
        RTCInboundRTPStreamStats, with attributes packetsReceived, bytesReceived, packetsLost,
        jitter, and fractionLost.
        </li>
        <li>It MUST support generating statistics for the type RTCOutboundRTPStreamStats, with
        attributes packetsSent, bytesSent.
        </li>
        <li>For all subclasses of RTCRtpStreamStats, it MUST include ssrc, associateStatsId,
        isRemote, mediaType.
        </li>
        <li>It MAY support generating other stats.

        Basic concepts
      </h2>
      <p>
        The stats API is defined in [[!WEBRTC]]. It is defined to return a set of objects that are
        a subclass of the RTCStats dictionary. This is normatively defined in [[!WEBRTC]], but is
        reproduced here for ease of reference.

    DOMHighResTimeStamp timestamp;

      </pre>
      <section>
        <h3>
          Guidelines for design of stats objects
        </h3>
        <p>
          When introducing a new stats type, the following principles should be followed:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>An RTCStats object should correspond to an object defined in the specification it
          supports.
          </li>
          <li>All members of the new object need to have definitions that make them consistently
          implementable. References to other specifications are a good way of doing this.
          </li>
          <li>All members need to have defined behavior for what happens before the thing it counts
          happens, or when the information it's supposed to show is not available. Usually, this
          will be "start at zero" or "do not populate the value".
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The new members of the stats dictionary need to be named according to standard practice
          (camelCase).
        </p>
        <p>
          Names ending in "Id" (such as "datachannelId") are always of type DOMString and are used
          to refer to other stats objects by the value of their "id" field; names ending in "Ids"
          (such as "trackIds") are always of type sequence&lt;DOMString&gt;, and are used to refer
          to a list of other stats objects.
        </p>
        <p>
          Stats are sampled by Javascript. In general, an application will not have overall control
          over how often stats are sampled, and the implementation cannot know what the intended
          use of the stats is. There is, by design, no control surface for the application to
          influence how stats are generated.
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore, letting the implementation compute "average" rates is not a good idea, since
          that implies some averaging time interval that can't be set beforehand. Instead, the
          recommended approach is to count the number of measurements of a value and sum the
          measurements given even if the sum is meaningless in itself; the JS application can then
          compute averages over any desired time interval by calling getStats() twice, taking the
          difference of the two sums and dividing by the difference of the two counts.
        </p>
        <p>
          For stats that are measured against time, such as byte counts, no separate counter is
          needed; one can instead divide by the difference in the timestamps.
        </p>

      <section>
        <h3>
          Guidelines for implementing stats objects
        </h3>
        <p>
          When implementing stats objects, the following guidelines should be adhered to:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>When a feature is not implemented on the platform, omit the dictionary member that is
          tracking usage of the feature.
          </li>
          <li>When a feature is not applicable to an instance of an object (for example audioLevel
          on a video stream), omit the dictionary member. Do NOT report a count of zero, -1 or
          "empty string".
          </li>
          <li>When a counted feature hasn't been used yet, but may happen in the future, report a
          count of zero.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>
          Lifetime of stats objects
        </h3>
        <p>
          The general rule is that stats objects, once created, exist for the lifetime of the
          PeerConnection that contains them, even when the underlying object they report on is
          stopped or deleted. This is important in order to report consistently on short-lived
          objects and to be able to report totals over the lifetime of a PeerConnection.
        </p>
        <p>
          When an object is closed or deleted, the <code>timestamp</code> member of the stats
          object stops updating; it is frozen at the time when the object stopped.
        </p>

      <h2>
        Maintenance procedures for stats types
      </h2>
      <p>
        This document, in its editors' draft form, serves as the repository for the currently
        defined set of stats types.
      </p>
      <p>
        If a need for a new stats dictionary or dictionary member is found, an issue should be
        raised against this spec on Github, and a review process will decide on whether the stat
        should be added to the specification or not.
      </p>
      <p>
        A pull request for a change to this document may serve as guidance for the discussion, but
        the eventual merge is dependent on the review process.
      </p>
      <p>
        While the WebRTC WG exist, it will serve as the review body; once it has disbanded, the W3C
        will have to establish appropriate review.
      </p>
      <p>
        The level of review sought is that of the IETF process' "expert review", as defined in
        [[RFC5226]] section 4.1. The documentation needed includes the names of the new stats,
        their data types, and the definitions they are based on, specified to a level that allows
        interoperable implementation. The specification may consist of references to other
        documents.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another specification that wishes to refer to a specific version (for instance for
        conformance) should refer to a dated version; these will be produced regularly when updates
        happen.

          An <code>RTCTransportStats</code> object represents the stats corresponding to an
          <code><a>RTCDtlsTransport</a></code> and its underlying
          <code><a>RTCIceTransport</a></code>. When RTCP multiplexing is used, one transport is
          used for both RTP and RTCP. Otherwise, RTP and RTCP will be sent on separate transports,
          and <code>rtcpTransportStatsId</code> can be used to pair the resulting
          <code>RTCTransportStats</code> objects. Additionally, when bundling is used, a single
          transport will be used for all <code><a>MediaStreamTrack</a></code>s in the bundle group.
          If bundling is not used, different <code><a>MediaStreamTrack</a></code> will use
          different transports. RTCP multiplexing and bundling are described in [[!WEBRTC]].

                  For local candidates, <code>true</code> indicates that the candidate has been
                  deleted/freed as described by [[!RFC5245]]. For host candidates, this means that
                  any network resources (typically a socket) associated with the candidate have
                  been released. For TURN candidates, this means the TURN allocation is no longer
                  active.

        <p>
          Consider the case where the user is experiencing bad sound and the application wants to
          determine if the cause of it is packet loss. The following example code might be used:
        </p>

var selector = pc.getRemoteStreams()[0].getAudioTracks()[0];

pc.getStats(selector, function (report) {

    pc.getStats(selector, function (report) {
        currentReport = report;

    // compare the elements from the current report with the baseline

            var packetsReceived = remoteNow.packetsReceived - remoteBase.packetsReceived;

            // if fractionLost is &gt; 0.3, we have probably found the culprit
            var fractionLost = (packetsSent - packetsReceived) / packetsSent;

      <h3>
        Security Considerations
      </h3>
      <p>
        Some stats identifiers may expose personally identifiable information, for example the IP
        addresses of the participating endpoints when a TURN relay is not used. 
        <!-- TODO: add guidance on how to not expose this information? -->
