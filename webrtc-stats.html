        Introduction
      </h2>
      <p>
        Audio, video, or data packets transmitted over a peer-connection can be lost, and
        experience varying amounts of network delay. A web application implementing WebRTC expects
        to monitor the performance of the underlying network and media pipeline.
      </p>
      <p>
        This document defines the statistic identifiers used by the web application to extract
        metrics from the user agent.

    <section id="conformance">
      <p>
        This specification defines the conformance criteria that applies to a single product: the
        <em>user agent</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Implementations that use ECMAScript to implement the objects defined in this specification
        <em class="rfc2119" title="MUST">MUST</em> implement them in a manner consistent with the
        ECMAScript Bindings defined in the Web IDL specification [[WEBIDL]], as this document uses
        that specification and terminology.
      </p>
      <p>
        This specification does not define what objects a conforming implementation should
        generate. Specifications that refer to this specification have the need to specify
        conformance. They should put in their document text like this:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>An implementation MUST support generating statistics for the type
        RTCInboundRTPStreamStats, with attributes packetsReceived, bytesReceived, packetsLost,
        jitter, and fractionLost.
        </li>
        <li>It MUST support generating statistics for the type RTCOutboundRTPStreamStats, with
        attributes packetsSent, bytesSent.
        </li>
        <li>For all subclasses of RTCRTPStreamStats, it MUST include ssrc and mediaType.
        When stats exist for both sides of a connection, in the form of an
        inbound-rtp / remote-outbound-rtp pair or an outbound-rtp /
        remote-inbound-rtp pair, the members remoteId and localId MUST also be present.
        </li>
        <li>It MAY support generating other stats.
        </li>

      <h2>
        Basic concepts
      </h2>
      <p>
        The basic object of the stats model is the <a>stats object</a>. The following terms are
        defined to describe it:
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt>
          <dfn>Monitored object</dfn>
        </dt>
        <dd>
          <p>
            An internal object that keeps a set of data values. Most monitored objects are object
            defined in the WebRTC API; they may be thought of as being internal properties of those
            objects.
          </p>
        </dd>
        <dt>
          <dfn>Stats object</dfn>
        </dt>
        <dd>
          This is a set of values, copied out from a monitored object at a specific moment in time.
          It is returned as a WebIDL dictionary through the getStats API call.
        </dd>
        <dt>
          <dfn>Stats object reference</dfn>
        </dt>
        <dd>
          <p>
            A monitored object has a stable identifier "id", which is reflected in all stats
            objects produced from the monitored object. Stats objects may contain references to
            other stats objects using this "id" value. In a <a>stats object</a>, these references
            are represented by a DOMString containing "id" value of the referenced stats object.
          </p>
          <p>
            All stats object references have type DOMString and attribute names ending in 'Id', or
            they have type sequence&lt;DOMString&gt; and attribute names ending in 'Ids'.
          </p>
        </dd>
        <dt>
          <dfn>Stats value</dfn>
        </dt>
        <dd>
          Refers to a single value within a stats object.
        </dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        A monitored object changes the values it contains continuously over its lifetime, but is
        never visible through the getStats API call. A stats object, once returned, never changes.
      </p>
      <p>
        The stats API is defined in [[!WEBRTC]]. It is defined to return a collection of <a>stats
        object</a>s, each of which is a dictionary inheriting directly or indirectly from the
        <a>RTCStats</a> dictionary. This API is normatively defined in [[!WEBRTC]], but is
        reproduced here for ease of reference.
      </p>
      <pre class="idl">
        dictionary RTCStats {
    DOMHighResTimeStamp timestamp;
    RTCStatsType        type;
    DOMString           id;
        };
      </pre>
      <p>
        Timestamps are expressed with DOMHighResTimeStamp [[!HIGHRES-TIME]]. Unless otherwise
        specified, timestamps are relative to the UNIX epoch (Jan 1, 1970, UTC) and are measured
        by a local clock.
      </p>
      <section>
        <h3>
          Guidelines for design of stats objects
        </h3>
        <p>
          When introducing a new stats object, the following principles should be followed:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>An RTCStats object should correspond to an object defined in the specification it
          supports.
          </li>
          <li>The object MUST define a new value in the "RTCStastType" enum, and MUST define the
          syntax of the <a>stats object</a> it returns either by reference to an existing
          sub-dictionary of <a>RTCStats</a> or by defining a new sub-dictionary of <a>RTCStats</a>.
          </li>
          <li>All members of the new object need to have definitions that make them consistently
          implementable. References to other specifications are a good way of doing this.
          </li>
          <li>All members need to have defined behavior for what happens before the thing it counts
          happens, or when the information it's supposed to show is not available. Usually, this
          will be "start at zero" or "do not populate the value".
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The new members of the stats dictionary need to be named according to standard practice
          (camelCase).
        </p>
        <p>
          Names ending in "Id" (such as "datachannelId") are always a <a>stats object
          reference</a>; names ending in "Ids" (such as "trackIds") are always of type
          sequence&lt;DOMString&gt;, where each DOMString is a <a>stats object reference</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Stats are sampled by Javascript. In general, an application will not have overall control
          over how often stats are sampled, and the implementation cannot know what the intended
          use of the stats is. There is, by design, no control surface for the application to
          influence how stats are generated.
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore, letting the implementation compute "average" rates is not a good idea, since
          that implies some averaging time interval that can't be set beforehand. Instead, the
          recommended approach is to count the number of measurements of a value and sum the
          measurements given even if the sum is meaningless in itself; the JS application can then
          compute averages over any desired time interval by calling getStats() twice, taking the
          difference of the two sums and dividing by the difference of the two counts.
        </p>
        <p>
          For stats that are measured against time, such as byte counts, no separate counter is
          needed; one can instead divide by the difference in the timestamps.
        </p>

        <h3>
          Guidelines for implementing stats objects
        </h3>
        <p>
          When implementing stats objects, the following guidelines should be adhered to:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>When a feature is not implemented on the platform, omit the dictionary member that is
          tracking usage of the feature.
          </li>
          <li>When a feature is not applicable to an instance of an object (for example audioLevel
          on a video stream), omit the dictionary member. Do NOT report a count of zero, -1 or
          "empty string".
          </li>
          <li>When a counted feature hasn't been used yet, but may happen in the future, report a
          count of zero.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>
          Stats objects for deleted monitored objects
        </h3>
        <p>
          When a monitored object is destroyed, a final stats object is produced, carrying the
          values current at the time of destruction. This object will be returned, with a timestamp
          reflecting the time of destruction, whenever getStats() is called, as long as the
          PeerConnection exists. This is important in order to report consistently on short-lived
          objects and to be able to consistently report totals over the lifetime of a
          PeerConnection.

        Maintenance procedures for stats object types

      <section>
        <h3>
          Adding new stats objects
        </h3>
        <p>
          This document, in its editors' draft form, serves as the repository for the currently
          defined set of stats object types.
        </p>
        <p>
          If a need for a new stats object type or stats value within a stats object is found, an
          issue should be raised against this spec on Github, and a review process will decide on
          whether the stat should be added to the specification or not.
        </p>
        <p>
          A pull request for a change to this document may serve as guidance for the discussion,
          but the eventual merge is dependent on the review process.
        </p>
        <p>
          While the WebRTC WG exist, it will serve as the review body; once it has disbanded, the
          W3C will have to establish appropriate review.
        </p>
        <p>
          The level of review sought is that of the IETF process' "expert review", as defined in
          [[RFC5226]] section 4.1. The documentation needed includes the names of the new stats,
          their data types, and the definitions they are based on, specified to a level that allows
          interoperable implementation. The specification may consist of references to other
          documents.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another specification that wishes to refer to a specific version (for instance for
          conformance) should refer to a dated version; these will be produced regularly when
          updates happen.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>
          Retiring stats objects
        </h3>
        <p>
          At times, it makes sense to retire the definition for a stats object or a stats value.
          When this happens, it is not advisable to simply delete it from the spec, since there may
          be implementations out there that use it, and it is important that the name is reserved
          from re-use for another, incompatible definition.
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore, retired stats objects are moved to a separate section in this document.
          Retired stats objects are moved there in their entirety; retired stats values are moved
          to a "partial dictionary".
        </p>
        <p>
          If there is no evidence that the retired object definition has ever been used (such as an
          object that is added to the spec and renamed, redefined or removed prior to
          implementation), the editors can decide to just remove the object from the spec.

                  The playout time is the NTP timestamp of the last playable audio sample or video
                  frame that has a known timestamp (from an RTCP SR packet mapping RTP timestamps to
                  NTP timestamps), extrapolated with the time elapsed since it was ready to be
                  played out. This is the "current time" of the track in NTP clock time of the
                  sender and can be present even if there is no audio or video currently playing.

          An <code>RTCTransportStats</code> object represents the stats corresponding to an
          <code><a>RTCDtlsTransport</a></code> and its underlying
          <code><a>RTCIceTransport</a></code>. When RTCP multiplexing is used, one transport is
          used for both RTP and RTCP. Otherwise, RTP and RTCP will be sent on separate transports,
          and <code>rtcpTransportStatsId</code> can be used to pair the resulting
          <code>RTCTransportStats</code> objects. Additionally, when bundling is used, a single
          transport will be used for all <code><a>MediaStreamTrack</a></code>s in the bundle group.
          If bundling is not used, different <code><a>MediaStreamTrack</a></code> will use
          different transports. RTCP multiplexing and bundling are described in [[!WEBRTC]].

          Example of a stats application
        </h3>
        <p>
          Consider the case where the user is experiencing bad sound and the application wants to
          determine if the cause of it is packet loss. The following example code might be used:
        </p>
        <pre class="example highlight">var baselineReport, currentReport;
var sender = pc.getSenders()[0];

sender.getStats().then(function (report) {
    baselineReport = report;
})
.then(function() {
    return new Promise(function(resolve) {
        setTimeout(resolve, aBit); // ... wait a bit
    });
})
.then(function() {
    return sender.getStats();
})
.then(function (report) {
    currentReport = report;
    processStats();
})
.catch(function (error) {
  console.log(error.toString());
});

function processStats() {
    // compare the elements from the current report with the baseline
    for (let now of currentReport.values()) {
        if (now.type != "outbound-rtp")
            continue;

        // get the corresponding stats from the baseline report
        let base = baselineReport.get(now.id);

        if (base) {
            remoteNow = currentReport[now.remoteId];
            remoteBase = baselineReport[base.remoteId];

            var packetsSent = now.packetsSent - base.packetsSent;
            var packetsReceived = remoteNow.packetsReceived - remoteBase.packetsReceived;

            // if intervalFractionLoss is > 0.3, we've probably found the culprit
            var intervalFractionLoss = (packetsSent - packetsReceived) / packetsSent;
        }
    });

      <h3>
        Security Considerations
      </h3>
      <p>
        Some stats identifiers may expose personally identifiable information, for example the IP
        addresses of the participating endpoints when a TURN relay is not used.
        <!-- TODO: add guidance on how to not expose this information? -->
