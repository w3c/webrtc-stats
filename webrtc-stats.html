        Introduction
      </h2>
      <p>
        Audio, video, or data packets transmitted over a peer-connection can be lost, and
        experience varying amounts of network delay. A web application implementing WebRTC expects
        to monitor the performance of the underlying network and media pipeline.
      </p>
      <p>
        This document defines the statistic identifiers used by the web application to extract
        metrics from the user agent.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id="conformance">
      <p>
        This specification defines the conformance criteria that applies to a single product: the
        <em>user agent</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Implementations that use ECMAScript to implement the objects defined in this specification
        <em class="rfc2119" title="MUST">MUST</em> implement them in a manner consistent with the
        ECMAScript Bindings defined in the Web IDL specification [[WEBIDL]], as this document uses
        that specification and terminology.
      </p>
      <p>
        This specification does not define what objects a conforming implementation should
        generate. Specifications that refer to this specification have the need to specify
        conformance. They should put in their document text that could like this (EXAMPLE ONLY):
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>An implementation MUST support generating statistics for the type
        {{RTCInboundRtpStreamStats}}, with members {{RTCReceivedRtpStreamStats/packetsReceived}}, {{RTCInboundRtpStreamStats/bytesReceived}}, {{RTCReceivedRtpStreamStats/packetsLost}}, and
        {{RTCReceivedRtpStreamStats/jitter}}.
        </li>
        <li>It MUST support generating statistics for the type {{RTCOutboundRtpStreamStats}}, with
        members {{RTCSentRtpStreamStats/packetsSent}}, {{RTCSentRtpStreamStats/bytesSent}}.
        </li>
        <li>For all subclasses of {{RTCRtpStreamStats}}, it MUST include {{RTCRtpStreamStats/ssrc}} and {{RTCRtpStreamStats/kind}}. When stats
        exist for both sides of a connection, in the form of an {{RTCStatsType/"inbound-rtp"}} / {{RTCStatsType/"remote-outbound-rtp"}}
        pair or an {{RTCStatsType/"outbound-rtp"}} / {{RTCStatsType/"remote-inbound-rtp"}} pair, the members {{RTCOutboundRtpStreamStats/remoteId}} and {{RTCRemoteOutboundRtpStreamStats/localId}} MUST
        also be present.
        </li>
        <li>It MAY support generating other stats.
        </li>

      <h2>
        Basic concepts
      </h2>
      <p>
        The basic object of the stats model is the [= stats object =]. The following terms are
        defined to describe it:
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt>
          <dfn data-export>Monitored object</dfn>
        </dt>
        <dd>
          <p>
            An internal object that keeps a set of data values. Most monitored objects are object
            defined in the WebRTC API; they may be thought of as being internal properties of those
            objects.
          </p>
        </dd>
        <dt>
          <dfn data-export>Stats object</dfn>
        </dt>
        <dd>
          This is a set of values, copied out from a monitored object at a specific moment in time.
          It is returned as a WebIDL dictionary through the getStats API call.
        </dd>
        <dt>
          <dfn data-export>Stats object reference</dfn>
        </dt>
        <dd>
          <p>
            A monitored object has a stable identifier <var>id</var>, which is reflected in all stats
            objects produced from the monitored object. Stats objects may contain references to
            other stats objects using this <var>id</var> value. In a [= stats object =], these references
            are represented by a {{DOMString}} containing <var>id</var> value of the referenced stats object.
          </p>
          <p>
            All stats object references have type {{DOMString}} and member names ending in <code>Id</code>, or
            they have type <code>sequence&lt;{{DOMString}}&gt;</code> and member names ending in <code>Ids</code>.
          </p>
        </dd>
        <dt>
          <dfn data-export>Stats value</dfn>
        </dt>
        <dd>
          Refers to a single value within a stats object.
        </dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        A monitored object changes the values it contains continuously over its lifetime, but is
        never visible through the getStats API call. A stats object, once returned, never changes.
      </p>
      <p>
        The stats API is defined in [[!WEBRTC]]. It is defined to return a collection of [= stats object =]s, each of which is a dictionary inheriting directly or indirectly from the
        {{RTCStats}} dictionary. This API is normatively defined in [[!WEBRTC]], but is
        reproduced here for ease of reference.
      </p>
      <pre class="idl informative">
dictionary RTCStats {
    required DOMHighResTimeStamp timestamp;
    required RTCStatsType        type;
    required DOMString           id;
};
      </pre>
      <p>
        Timestamps are expressed with {{DOMHighResTimeStamp}} [[HIGHRES-TIME]], and are defined as
        {{Performance.timeOrigin}} +
              {{Performance.now()}} at the time the information is
        collected.

        <h3>
          Guidelines for design of stats objects
        </h3>
        <p>
          When introducing a new stats object, the following principles should be followed:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>An {{RTCStats}} object should correspond to an object defined in the specification it
          supports.
          </li>
          <li>The object MUST define a new value in the {{RTCStatsType}} enum, and MUST define the
          syntax of the [= stats object =] it returns either by reference to an existing
          sub-dictionary of {{RTCStats}} or by defining a new sub-dictionary of {{RTCStats}}.
          </li>
          <li>All members of the new object need to have definitions that make them consistently
          implementable. References to other specifications are a good way of doing this.
          </li>
          <li>All members need to have defined behavior for what happens before the thing it counts
          happens, or when the information it's supposed to show is not available. Usually, this
          will be "start at zero" or "do not populate the value".
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The new members of the stats dictionary need to be named according to standard practice
          (camelCase), as per [[API-DESIGN-PRINCIPLES]].
        </p>
        <p>
          Names ending in <code>Id</code> (such as {{RTCRtpStreamStats/transportId}}) are always a [= stats object reference =];
          <!-- TODO: Ids name are only obsolete now? -->
          names ending in <code>Ids</code> (such as {{RTCMediaStreamStats/trackIds}}) are always of type sequence&lt;DOMString&gt;,
          where each {{DOMString}} is a [= stats object reference =].
        </p>
        <p>
          If the natural name for a stats value would end in <code>id</code> (such as when the stats value is
          an in-protocol identifier for the monitored object), the recommended practice is to let
          the name end in <code>identifier</code>, such as {{RTCDataChannelStats/dataChannelIdentifier}}.
        </p>
        <p>
          Stats are sampled by Javascript. In general, an application will not have overall control
          over how often stats are sampled, and the implementation cannot know what the intended
          use of the stats is. There is, by design, no control surface for the application to
          influence how stats are generated.
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore, letting the implementation compute "average" rates is not a good idea, since
          that implies some averaging time interval that can't be set beforehand. Instead, the
          recommended approach is to count the number of measurements of a value and sum the
          measurements given even if the sum is meaningless in itself; the JS application can then
          compute averages over any desired time interval by calling getStats() twice, taking the
          difference of the two sums and dividing by the difference of the two counts.
        </p>
        <p>
          For stats that are measured against time, such as byte counts, no separate counter is
          needed; one can instead divide by the difference in the timestamps.
        </p>

        <h3>
          Guidelines for implementing stats objects
        </h3>
        <p>
          When implementing stats objects, the following guidelines should be adhered to:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>When a feature is not implemented on the platform, omit the dictionary member that is
          tracking usage of the feature.
          </li>
          <li>When a feature is not applicable to an instance of an object (for example {{RTCAudioHandlerStats/audioLevel}}
          on a video stream), omit the dictionary member. Do NOT report a count of zero, -1 or
          "empty string".
          </li>
          <li>When a counted feature hasn't been used yet, but may happen in the future, report a
          count of zero.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>
          Lifetime considerations for monitored objects
        </h3>
        <p>
          The object descriptions will say what the lifetime of a [= monitored object =] from the
          perspective of stats is. When a monitored object is <dfn>deleted</dfn>, it no longer appears in
          stats; until this happens, it will appear. This may or may not correspond to the actual
          lifetime of an object in an implementation; what matters for this specification is what
          appears in stats.
        </p>
        <p>
          If a monitored object can only exist in a few instances over the lifetime of a
          {{RTCPeerConnection}}, it may be simplest to consider it "eternal" and never delete it from
          the set of objects reported on in stats. This type of object will remain visible until
          the {{RTCPeerConnection}} is no longer available; it is also visible in {{RTCPeerConnection/getStats()}} after
          pc.close(). This is the default when no lifetime is mentioned in its specification.
        </p>
        <p>
          Objects that might exist in many instances over time should have a defined time at which
          they are [= deleted =], at which time they stop appearing in subsequent calls to {{RTCPeerConnection/getStats()}}.
          When an object is [= deleted =], we can guarantee that no subsequent {{RTCPeerConnection/getStats()}} call will
          contain a [= stats object reference =] that references the deleted object. We also
          guarantee that the stats id of the deleted object will never be reused for another
          object. This ensures that an application that collects [= stats object =]s for deleted
          [= monitored object =]s will always be able to uniquely identify the object pointed to
          in the result of any {{RTCPeerConnection/getStats()}} call.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>
          Guidelines for {{RTCPeerConnection/getStats()}} results caching/throttling
        </h3>
        <p>
          A call to {{RTCPeerConnection/getStats()}} touches many components of WebRTC and may take significant time to
          execute. The implementation may or may not utilize caching or throttling of {{RTCPeerConnection/getStats()}}
          calls for performance benefits, however any implementation must adhere to the following:
        </p>
        <p>
          When the state of the {{RTCPeerConnection}} visibly changes as a result of an API call, a
          promise resolving or an event firing, subsequent new {{RTCPeerConnection/getStats()}} calls must return
          up-to-date dictionaries for the affected objects. For example, if a track is added with
          {{RTCPeerConnection/addTrack()}} subsequent {{RTCPeerConnection/getStats()}} calls must resolve with a corresponding
          {{RTCMediaHandlerStats}} object. If you call {{RTCPeerConnection/setRemoteDescription()}} removing a remote track,
          upon the promise resolving or an associated event (stream's <code class=gum>onremovetrack</code> or track's
          <code class=gum>onmute</code>) firing, calling {{RTCPeerConnection/getStats()}} must resolve with an up-to-date {{RTCMediaHandlerStats}}
          object.
        </p>
        <p>
          When a stats object is [= deleted =], subsequent {{RTCPeerConnection/getStats()}} calls MUST NOT return stats
          for that [= monitored object =].

        Maintenance procedures for stats object types

        <h3>
          Adding new stats objects
        </h3>
        <p class="status-ED">
          This document, in its editors' draft form, serves as the repository for the currently
          defined set of stats object types including proposals for new standard types.
        </p>
        <p class="status-not-ED">
          This document specifies the interoperable stats object types. Proposals for new object
          types may be made in <a href="https://github.com/w3c/webrtc-stats/">the editors draft
          maintained on GitHub</a>. New standard types may appear in future revisions of the W3C
          Recommendation.
        </p>
        <p>
          If a need for a new stats object type or stats value within a stats object is found, an
          issue should be <a href="https://github.com/w3c/webrtc-stats/issues">raised on
          Github</a>, and a review process will decide on whether the stat should be added to the
          editors draft or not.
        </p>
        <p>
          A pull request for a change to the editors draft may serve as guidance for the
          discussion, but the eventual merge is dependent on the review process.
        </p>
        <p>
          While the WebRTC WG exists, it will serve as the review body; once it has disbanded, the
          W3C will have to establish appropriate review.
        </p>
        <p>
          The level of review sought is that of the IETF process' "expert review", as defined in
          [[RFC5226]] section 4.1. The documentation needed includes the names of the new stats,
          their data types, and the definitions they are based on, specified to a level that allows
          interoperable implementation. The specification may consist of references to other
          documents.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another specification that wishes to refer to a specific version (for instance for
          conformance) should refer to a dated version; these will be produced regularly when
          updates happen.

        <h3>
          Retiring stats objects
        </h3>
        <p>
          At times, it makes sense to retire the definition for a stats object or a stats value.
          When this happens, it is not advisable to simply delete it from the spec, since there may
          be implementations out there that use it, and it is important that the name is reserved
          from re-use for another, incompatible definition.
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore, retired stats objects are moved to a separate section in this document.
          Retired stats objects are moved there in their entirety; retired stats values are moved
          to a "partial dictionary".
        </p>
        <p>
          If there is no evidence that the retired object definition has ever been used (such as an
          object that is added to the spec and renamed, redefined or removed prior to
          implementation), the editors can decide to just remove the object from the spec.

          The RTP statistics hierarchy
        </h3>
        <p>
          The dictionaries for RTP statistics are structured as a hierarchy, so that those stats
          that make sense in many different contexts are represented just once in IDL.
        </p>
        <p>
          The metrics exposed here correspond to local measurements and those reported by RTCP packets. 
          Compound RTCP packets contain multiple RTCP report blocks, such as <a>Sender Report</a> (SR) and 
          <a>Receiver Report</a> (RR) whereas a non-compound RTCP packets may contain just a single 
          RTCP SR or RR block.
        </p>
        <p>
          The lifetime of all RTP [= monitored object =]s starts when the <a>RTP stream</a> is first
          used: When the first RTP packet is sent or received on the <a>SSRC</a> it represents, or when
          the first RTCP packet is sent or received that refers to the <a>SSRC</a> of the <a>RTP stream</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          RTP monitored objects are not [= deleted =].
        </p>
        <p>
          The hierarchy is as follows:
        </p>
        <p>

          This object is created when a codec type is registered for
          an RTP transport. It may be referenced by multiple RTP streams
          in media sections using that transport, but similar codecs in
          different transports have different RTCCodecStats objects.

                  The definition of QP value depends on the codec; for VP8, the QP value is the

                  [[RFC6386]] section 19.2. Its range is 0..127.

                <p>
                  Note that the QP value is only an indication of quantizer values used; many
                  formats have ways to vary the quantizer value within the frame.

                  It is the sum of the time, in seconds, each <a>audio sample</a> or video frame takes from
                  the time the first RTP packet is received (reception timestamp) and to the time 
                  the corresponding sample or frame is decoded (decoded timestamp). At this point the audio 
                  sample or video frame is ready for playout by the MediaStreamTrack. Typically ready for 
                  playout here means after the audio sample or video frame is fully decoded by the decoder.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Given the complexities involved, the time of arrival or the reception timestamp is measured 
                  as close to the network layer as possible and the decoded timestamp is measured as soon as the
                  complete sample or frame is decoded.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In the case of audio, several samples are received in the same RTP packet, all samples
                  will share the same reception timestamp and different decoded timestamps. 
                  In the case of video, the frame is received over several RTP packets, in this
                  case the earliest timestamp containing the frame is counted as the reception timestamp,
                  and the decoded timestamp corresponds to when the complete frame is decoded.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This metric is not incremented for frames that are not decoded, 
                  i.e., {{RTCReceivedRtpStreamStats/framesDropped}}, {{RTCReceivedRtpStreamStats/partialFramesLost}},
                  The average processing delay can be calculated by dividing the {{totalProcessingDelay}} with the
                  {{totalSamplesDecoded}} for audio or {{framesDecoded}} for video.

                  This is the estimated playout time of this receiver's track. The playout time is
                  the NTP timestamp of the last playable <a>audio sample</a> or video frame that has a known
                  timestamp (from an <a>RTCP SR</a> packet mapping RTP timestamps to NTP timestamps),
                  extrapolated with the time elapsed since it was ready to be played out. This is
                  the "current time" of the track in NTP clock time of the sender and can be present

                  The purpose of the jitter buffer is to recombine RTP packets into frames (in the case of video)
                  and have smooth playout. The model described here assumes that the samples or frames are 
                  still compressed and have not yet been decoded.
                  It is the sum of the time, in seconds, each <a>audio sample</a> or a video frame takes from
                  the time the first packet is received by the jitter buffer (ingest timestamp) to the 
                  time it exits the jitter buffer (emit timestamp). 
                  In the case of audio, several samples belong to the same RTP packet, hence they will have the same 
                  ingest timestamp but different jitter buffer emit timestamps. 
                  In the case of video, the frame maybe is received over several RTP packets, hence the ingest timestamp
                  is the earliest packet of the frame that entered the jitter buffer and the emit timestamp is 
                  when the whole frame exits the jitter buffer.
                  This metric increases upon samples or frames exiting, having completed their time in the buffer (and
                  incrementing {{jitterBufferEmittedCount}}). The average jitter buffer
                  delay can be calculated by dividing the {{jitterBufferDelay}} with the

                  This value MUST be computed as follows: for each <a>audio sample</a> that is received
                  (and thus counted by {{totalSamplesReceived}}), add the sample's
                  value divided by the highest-intensity encodable value, squared and then
                  multiplied by the duration of the sample in seconds. In other words,
                  <code>duration * Math.pow(energy/maxEnergy, 2)</code>.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This can be used to obtain a root mean square (RMS) value that uses the same
                  units as {{audioLevel}}, as defined in [[RFC6464]]. It can be
                  converted to these units using the formula
                  <code>Math.sqrt(totalAudioEnergy/totalSamplesDuration)</code>. This calculation
                  can also be performed using the differences between the values of two different
                  {{RTCPeerConnection/getStats()}} calls, in order to compute the average audio level over
                  any desired time interval. In other words, do <code>Math.sqrt((energy2 -

                <p>
                  For example, if a 10ms packet of audio is produced with an RMS of 0.5 (out of

                  {{totalAudioEnergy}}. If another 10ms packet with an RMS of 0.1 is
                  received, this should similarly add <code>0.0001</code> to
                  {{totalAudioEnergy}}. Then,
                  <code>Math.sqrt(totalAudioEnergy/totalSamplesDuration)</code> becomes
                  <code>Math.sqrt(0.0026/0.02) = 0.36</code>, which is the same value that would be
                  obtained by doing an RMS calculation over the contiguous 20ms segment of audio.

                  2.5 times the average size of the frames. The average size of the frames is defined
                  as the target bitrate per second divided by the target FPS at the time the frame was
                  encoded. These are usually complex to encode frames with a lot of changes in the
                  picture. This can be used to estimate, e.g slide changes in the streamed presentation.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The multiplier of 2.5 is choosen from analyzing encoded frame sizes for a sample
                  presentation using WebRTC standalone implementation. 2.5 is a reasonably large
                  multiplier which still caused all slide change events to be identified as a huge
                  frames. It, however, produced 1.4% of false positive slide change detections
                  which is deemed reasonable.

        <p>
          The <dfn>RTCMediaSourceStats</dfn> dictionary represents a track that is currently
          attached to one or more senders. It contains information about media sources such as
          frame rate and resolution prior to encoding. This is the media passed from the
          {{MediaStreamTrack}} to the {{RTCRtpSender}}s. This is in contrast to
          {{RTCOutboundRtpStreamStats}} whose members describe metrics as measured after
          the encoding step. For example, a track may be captured from a high-resolution camera,
          its frames downscaled due to track constraints and then further downscaled by the
          encoders due to CPU and network conditions. This dictionary reflects the video frames or
          <a>audio sample</a>s passed out from the track - after track constraints have been applied but
          before any encoding or further donwsampling occurs.
        </p>
        <p>
          Media source objects are of either subdictionary {{RTCAudioSourceStats}} or
          {{RTCVideoSourceStats}}. The {{RTCStats/type}} is the same
          ({{RTCStatsType/"media-source"}}) but {{RTCMediaSourceStats/kind}} is different (<code class=gum>"audio"</code> or
          <code class=gum>"video"</code>) depending on the kind of track.
        </p>
        <p>
          The media source stats objects are created when a track is attached to any
          {{RTCRtpSender}} and may subsequently be attached to multiple senders during its
          life. The life of this object ends when the track is no longer attached to any sender of
          the same {{RTCPeerConnection}}. If a track whose media source object ended is
          attached again this results in a new media source stats object whose counters (such as
          number of frames) are reset.

                  Represents the audio energy of the media source. For audio energy of remotely
                  sourced tracks, see {{RTCAudioReceiverStats}} instead.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This value MUST be computed as follows: for each <a>audio sample</a> produced by the
                  media source during the lifetime of this stats object, add the sample's value
                  divided by the highest-intensity encodable value, squared and then multiplied by
                  the duration of the sample in seconds. In other words, <code>duration *
                  Math.pow(energy/maxEnergy, 2)</code>.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This can be used to obtain a root mean square (RMS) value that uses the same
                  units as {{audioLevel}}, as defined in [[RFC6464]]. It can be
                  converted to these units using the formula
                  <code>Math.sqrt(totalAudioEnergy/totalSamplesDuration)</code>. This calculation
                  can also be performed using the differences between the values of two different
                  {{RTCPeerConnection/getStats()}} calls, in order to compute the average audio level over
                  any desired time interval. In other words, do <code>Math.sqrt((energy2 -
                  energy1)/(duration2 - duration1))</code>.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For example, if a 10ms packet of audio is produced with an RMS of 0.5 (out of
                  1.0), this should add <code>0.5 * 0.5 * 0.01 = 0.0025</code> to
                  {{totalAudioEnergy}}. If another 10ms packet with an RMS of 0.1 is
                  received, this should similarly add <code>0.0001</code> to
                  {{totalAudioEnergy}}. Then,
                  <code>Math.sqrt(totalAudioEnergy/totalSamplesDuration)</code> becomes
                  <code>Math.sqrt(0.0026/0.02) = 0.36</code>, which is the same value that would be
                  obtained by doing an RMS calculation over the contiguous 20ms segment of audio.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If multiple audio channels are used, the
                  audio energy of a sample refers to the <strong>highest energy</strong> of any
                  channel.

          The {{RTCRtpContributingSourceStats}} dictionary represents the measurement

          Each contributing source produces a stream of RTP packets, which are combined by a mixer
          into a single stream of RTP packets that is ultimately received by the WebRTC endpoint.
          Information about the sources that contributed to this combined stream may be provided in
          the CSRC list or [[RFC6465]] header extension of received RTP packets. The

          An {{RTCTransportStats}} object represents the stats corresponding to an
          {{RTCDtlsTransport}} and its underlying
          {{RTCIceTransport}}. When RTCP multiplexing is used, one transport is
          used for both RTP and RTCP. Otherwise, RTP and RTCP will be sent on separate transports,
          and {{RTCTransportStats/rtcpTransportStatsId}} can be used to pair the resulting
          {{RTCTransportStats}} objects. Additionally, when bundling is used, a single
          transport will be used for all {{MediaStreamTrack}}s in the bundle group.
          If bundling is not used, different {{MediaStreamTrack}} will use
          different transports. RTCP multiplexing and bundling are described in [[!WEBRTC]].

                  The user agent should make sure that only remote candidate addresses that the web
                  application has configured on the corresponding {{RTCPeerConnection}} are exposed;
                  This is especially important for peer reflexive remote candidates. By default,
                  the user agent MUST leave the {{RTCIceCandidateStats/address}} member as <code>null</code> in the
                  {{RTCIceCandidateStats}} dictionary of any remote candidate. Once a {{RTCPeerConnection}}
                  instance learns on an address by the web application using {{RTCPeerConnection/addIceCandidate()}},
                  the user agent can expose the 'address' member value in any remote
                  {{RTCIceCandidateStats}} dictionary of the corresponding {{RTCPeerConnection}} that
                  matches the newly learnt address.

                  were never used. For pairs in use, the estimate is normally no lower than the
                  bitrate for the packets sent at {{lastPacketSentTimestamp}}, but might
                  be higher. For candidate pairs that are not currently in use but were used

                  bitrate for all the incoming <a>RTP stream</a>s using this candidate pair. The bitrate
                  measurement does not count the size of the IP or other transport layers like TCP
                  or UDP. It is similar to the TIAS defined in [[!RFC3890]], i.e., it is measured
                  in bits per second and the bitrate is calculated over a 1 second window.

          Example of a stats application
        </h3>
        <p>
          Consider the case where the user is experiencing bad sound and the application wants to
          determine if the cause of it is packet loss. The following example code might be used:
        </p>
        <pre class="example highlight">var baselineReport, currentReport;
var sender = pc.getSenders()[0];

sender.getStats().then(function (report) {
    baselineReport = report;
})
.then(function() {
    return new Promise(function(resolve) {
        setTimeout(resolve, aBit); // ... wait a bit
    });
})
.then(function() {
    return sender.getStats();
})
.then(function (report) {
    currentReport = report;
    processStats();
})
.catch(function (error) {
  console.log(error.toString());
});

function processStats() {
    // compare the elements from the current report with the baseline
    for (let now of currentReport.values()) {
        if (now.type != "outbound-rtp")
            continue;

        // get the corresponding stats from the baseline report
        let base = baselineReport.get(now.id);

        if (base) {
            remoteNow = currentReport[now.remoteId];
            remoteBase = baselineReport[base.remoteId];

            var packetsSent = now.packetsSent - base.packetsSent;
            var packetsReceived = remoteNow.packetsReceived - remoteBase.packetsReceived;

            // if intervalFractionLoss is &gt; 0.3, we've probably found the culprit
            var intervalFractionLoss = (packetsSent - packetsReceived) / packetsSent;
        }
    });

        Security and Privacy Considerations
      </h3>
      <p>
        The data exposed by WebRTC Statistics include most of the media and network data also
        exposed by [[!GETUSERMEDIA]] and [[!WEBRTC]] - as such, all the privacy and security
        considerations of these specifications related to data exposure apply as well to this
        specifciation.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition, the properties exposed by {{RTCReceivedRtpStreamStats}},
        {{RTCRemoteInboundRtpStreamStats}}, {{RTCSentRtpStreamStats}},
        {{RTCOutboundRtpStreamStats}}, {{RTCRemoteOutboundRtpStreamStats}},
        {{RTCIceCandidatePairStats}}, {{RTCTransportStats}} expose network-layer data not
        currently available to the JavaScript layer.
      </p>
      <p>
        Beyond the risks associated with revealing <a data-cite="WEBRTC#revealing-ip-addresses">IP
        addresses as discussed in the WebRTC 1.0 specification</a>, some combination of the network
        properties uniquely exposed by this specification can be correlated with location.
      </p>
      <p>
        For instance, the round-trip time exposed in {{RTCRemoteInboundRtpStreamStats}} can give
        some coarse indication on how far aparts the peers are located, and thus, if one of the
        peer's location is known, this may reveal information about the other peer.
      </p>
      <p>
        When applied to isolated streams, media metrics may allow an application to infer some
        characteristics of the isolated stream, such as if anyone is speaking (by watching the
        {{RTCAudioSourceStats/audioLevel}} statistic).
      </p>
      <p>
        The following stats are deemed to be sensitive, and MUST NOT be reported for an
        <a data-cite="WEBRTC-IDENTITY#isolated-media-streams">isolated media stream</a>:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          {{RTCAudioHandlerStats.audioLevel}}.
        </li>
        <li>
